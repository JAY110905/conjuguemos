This is for educational purposes only. If this is used to cheat in any way, it's not my fault. You have been warned.
## Installation
To run this program, you need Python installed on your computer, which you can install from [www.python.org](https://www.python.org/). Once Python is downloaded, you need to run this command:
```
pip install pyautogui
```
This will install `pyautogui`, which is necessary for the program to run. The program is tested for Windows 10, but all software is supposed to be cross-compatible and should work on almost any major operating system.
## Setup for Conjuguemos
...
## Setting up the program
To set up the program, open `conjuguemos.py` in any text editor. We recommend [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), but Notepad or TextEdit will work just fine. Looking at the first 12 lines, edit the variables according to the instructions in the file. Don't remove any single-quotes (`'`), as this will cause an error and prevent the program from running.
## Running the program
Open `conjuguemos.py` with a double-click. After the file is open, click on the input box on [Conjuguemos.com]. Then, wait for the console window to say `Done.` or for the program to stop typing. Then, record your score using the button in the upper right.
